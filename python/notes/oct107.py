"""
when converting decimal to binary, you stop when the quotient is 2 or less

convert base 10 to any base
25 % base = remainder
25 / base = new quotient

then take new quotient and get new remainder and new quotient


25 % 2 = 1
25 / 2 = 12

2^0 = 1
2^1 = 0
2^2 = 0
and so on

change 2 to any base to convert to given bases

when we add in base 10, when the row goes over or to 10, we carry over to next place
when we add in base 2(binary), when the row goes over or to 2, we carry over to next place
