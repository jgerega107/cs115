#first function call in a recursion problem is not considered a recursive call, this is for when you get a problem that asks how many recursive calls.

#multiple recursion is called TREE recursion
#single recursion is called LINEAR recursion ONLY IF THERE IS COMPUTATION AFTER THE RETURN
#otherwise, it is called tail recursion if there is no computation

#REVIEW YOUR DEEP REVERSE FUNCTION!!!!!!

"""
PROBLEM 6
Assume lst is a list of values, some of which may also be lists. Returns a list with all the values collapsed in reverse order. In other words,
nesting has been removed and the values as they appear from left to right in the input list are now returned from right to left. You may
not use negative indexing or slicing.

"""
PROBLEM 7
Assume values is a list of integers that are the squares of the original values
for those original values that are less than the threshold."""
